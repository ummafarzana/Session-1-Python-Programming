This Python script is designed to teach you the basics of variables and data types in Python.
We will cover:
1. What variables are and how to use them.
2. The basic data types in Python.
3. Variable naming conventions and industry standards.
4. Python's dynamic typing feature.

Each section includes explanations, examples, and assignments to reinforce your learning.

# Section 1: Variables
# ---------------------
# Variables are containers for storing data values. In Python, a variable is created the moment you first assign a value to it.

# Example 1: Creating Variables
x = 5
y = "Hello, Python learners!"

# You can print the variables to see their values.
# print(x)
# print(y)

# Assignment 1: Create two variables, one holding a number and the other holding your name. Then print both.
# Write your code below:

# Define the variables
number = 201235
name = "Farzana"

# Print the variables
print("Number:", number)
print("Name:", name)

# Section 2: Data Types
# ---------------------
# Python has various data types including integers, float (decimal numbers), strings, booleans, and more.

# Example 2: Data Types
a = 5               # int
b = 3.14            # float
c = "Python"        # str
d = True            # bool

# You can check the type of any variable by using the type() function.
print(type(a))
print(type(b))
print(type(c))
print(type(d))

# Assignment 2: Create variables of different types and use the type() function to check their types.
# Write your code below:
# Define variables of different types
integer_var = 10          # Integer
float_var = 3.14          # Float
string_var = "Hello"      # String
boolean_var = True        # Boolean
list_var = [1, 2, 3]      # List
set_var = {7, 8, 9}       # Set
dict_var = {"key": "value"}  # Dictionary

# Check their types using type()
print("Type of integer_var:", type(integer_var))
print("Type of float_var:", type(float_var))
print("Type of string_var:", type(string_var))
print("Type of boolean_var:", type(boolean_var))
print("Type of list_var:", type(list_var))
print("Type of set_var:", type(set_var))
print("Type of dict_var:", type(dict_var))

# Section 3: Variable Naming Conventions and Industry Standards
# -------------------------------------------------------------
"""
Variable names should be:
- Clear, descriptive & relevant.
- Start with a letter or an underscore.
- Only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _).
- Case-sensitive (age, Age, and AGE are different variables).

Industry standards often follow the 'snake_case' naming style for variables in Python.
"""

# Example 3: Good and Bad Variable Names
good_name = "John"
_bad_name = 23
# 2bad = 42  # This will raise a SyntaxError because variable names cannot begin with a number.

# Assignment 3: Fix the bad variable name above and create three more variables with good naming practices.
# Write your code below:
# Corrected variable name
bad_name_fixed = 42  # Renamed to follow naming rules

# Additional variables with good naming practices
first_name = "MD"
age = 30
is_student = True

# Print the variables to verify
print("bad_name_fixed:", bad_name_fixed)
print("first_name:", first_name)
print("age:", age)
print("is_student:", is_student)

# Section 4: Python's Dynamic Typing
# ----------------------------------
# Python is dynamically typed, which means you donâ€™t have to declare the type of variable while declaring it.

# Example 4: Dynamic Typing
var = "I am a string"
print(var)

var = 42
print(var)

# The variable 'var' changes type from str to int, demonstrating Python's dynamic typing.

# Assignment 4: Create a variable, assign it a value of one type, then reassign it to a different type and print both.
# Write your code below:
# Create a variable and assign it a value of one type
variable = 100  # Initially an integer
print("Initial value:", variable, "| Type:", type(variable))

# Reassign the variable to a different type
variable = "Now I'm a string!"  # Changed to a string
print("Reassigned value:", variable, "| Type:", type(variable))

# Congratulations on completing this part of the Python workshop!
# Review the assignments, try to solve them, and check your understanding of variables and data types.
